# wp-vue-mix
wp-vue-mix is a WordPress headless Vue SPA boilerplate. It uses Laravel Mix as the compiler and also included the following:

1. Vuex
2. vue-router
3. jQuery support

### Get Started
Under the theme folder /wp-vue-mix/, run "npm install" to install all npm packages. You do need newer node, npm version for this. Sorry I haven't looked into the exact versions. 

### Compile
Under the theme folder /wp-vue-mix/, run "npm run dev", "npm run prod" or "npm run watch". Learn more about [Laravel Mix](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/mix).

I hope it works for you. :thumbsup:
